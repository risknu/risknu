# Hello, everyone!ðŸ‘‹ ![kata](https://www.codewars.com/users/risknu_/badges/micro)
Hello everyone, my name is Mak and I was born in Kyiv. I am 14 years old and I am a programmer in C++/C and Python. I write projects for the library catpow that you might like. I also create and write many projects for society and security. Additionally, I write mini articles and collaborate with other people.

If you are interested in collaborating with me, I am always glad. You can write to me on Discord or via email, I always respond.

Glory to Ukraine!

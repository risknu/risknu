=== Greeting ===
Hey everyone! I'm a Python and C++ developer who enjoys creating fun projects. I'm a big fan of open-source software and prefer UNIX systems because they're convenient and open.

I work on a lot of different projects, but most of them are just fun experiments that probably won't make it to a final release. But hey, it is what it is.

If you'd like to get in touch with me, feel free to join my Discord server -> ... or message me on Telegram -> @risknu or email me at -> risknu.go@gmail.com.

Also, I recommend checking out my website -> risknu.github.io. There might be something interesting there, though I wouldn't count on it.

P.S. I'm currently working on some libraries in C/C++ and Python just for fun, so yeah, wish me luck! *fingers crossed*
